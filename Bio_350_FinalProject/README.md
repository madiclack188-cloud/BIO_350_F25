Final Project Notes 

Assignments:
- Either write a paragraph reflection on your work on the final project so far, including the steps listed under the final project module for this week, or submit a link to your github final project folder that covers these points.
    - So far my work on the final project has included finding and understanding the coding process of a paper which did take me a while to find. The paper I am using revolves around discovering how disease and wildfire disturbances alter the likelihood that seedlings sprout. For their statistical analysis they used a Bayesian generalized linear model for each species of tree seedlings they monitored. The link to the paper is: https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ecs2.2991 
    - Objective 
        - "(1) assess the influence of seed limitation, biotic competition, and abiotic conditions on seedling regeneration in resprouting populations; (2) investigate whether disease-fire interactions alter postfire seedling regeneration, which have implications for future disease dynamics and shifts in forest composition"
        - human altered fire regimes 
        - Sudden Oak Death (SOD)
- Have your dataset
    - In my excel drive, on the authors github, and saved in VSCode
- Have a question 
    - Spefics with SOD
        - Attempt to remove wildfire data and find how much SOD influenced seedling regeneration 
    - How much does SOD effect the results of this study? 
- What did you want to model?
    - I would like to do a Bayesian generalized linear model however if it proves to be out of my skillset I will be modeling with a normal linear model 
- Set up the model framework
