Final Project Notes 

Assignments:
- Either write a paragraph reflection on your work on the final project so far, including the steps listed under the final project module for this week, or submit a link to your github final project folder that covers these points.
    - So far my work on the final project has included finding and understanding the coding process of a paper which did take me a while to find. The paper I am using revolves around discovering how disease and wildfire disturbances alter the likelihood that seedlings sprout. For their statistical analysis they used a Bayesian generalized linear model for each species of tree seedlings they monitored. The link to the paper is: https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ecs2.2991 
    - Objective 
        - "(1) assess the influence of seed limitation, biotic competition, and abiotic conditions on seedling regeneration in resprouting populations; (2) investigate whether disease-fire interactions alter postfire seedling regeneration, which have implications for future disease dynamics and shifts in forest composition"
        - human altered fire regimes 
        - Sudden Oak Death (SOD)
- Have your dataset
    - In my excel drive, on the authors github, and saved in VSCode
- Have a question 
    - Spefics with SOD
        - Attempt to remove wildfire data and find how much SOD influenced seedling regeneration 
    - How much does SOD effect the results of this study? 
- What did you want to model?
    - I would like to do a Bayesian generalized linear model however if it proves to be out of my skillset I will be modeling with a normal linear model 
- Set up the model framework
- X --> description
- Goals for 11/18
    - What was the original paper about?
        - My paper is about how Sudden Oak Death (SOD) disease and wildfire suppression is effecting the likilhood that seedlings will sprout in an area previously effected by a wildfire that wiped out a large area of coastal California. 
        - Objective 
            - "(1) assess the influence of seed limitation, biotic competition, and abiotic conditions on seedling regeneration in resprouting populations; (2) investigate whether disease-fire interactions alter postfire seedling regeneration, which have implications for future disease dynamics and shifts in forest composition"
    - Did it model anything, or are you just using their data?
        - There were models in the original paper, however I am going to use their data to create a model with specific feature selections.
    - What is your question or idea?
        - I am hoping to find out how much Sudden Oak Death (SOD) is impacting seedling survival rates
        - Question 
            - How much does SOD effect the seedlings survival?
    - What are you specifically trying to model?
        - I am specifically trying to isolate the specific categories of the original data 
        - Why? How will it answer you question/idea?
            - I am hoping to better visualize the data and find the most common cause of seedling death.
    - What is your input data type or structure?
        - Numerical 
    - What is your output data type?
        - Numerical 
    - What type of model have you decided to use to model your data? 
        - "Model-based and sequential feature selection" 
        - Should expresses itself in a bar graph 
    - Practical: 
        - Have data loaded
        - Plot initial visualization 
        - Explain your data type and input/output plans for your model
            - Attributes I will be usiung 
                - Average Slope 
                - Elevation 
                - Fire Mortality 
                - Distance from Fire Edge 
                - Pre Fire SOD Mortality
        - Create a train/test data split
        - Explain your model 
            - Run a test using default or standard model parameters 
            - Later this week and over the next 2 weeks we will discuss fine tuning model parameters to generate the most accurate model 
        - Now that you've run the test, what are your results and what do they mean? 
            - The test I have run was mainly to figure out how to make the bar graph I need to answer my question 
            - It was successful, however it only shows what I already know from the data 
    - 11/20 
        - Making a scatter plot representing the data of all 46 columns if the original seedling data
            - inserting line of best fit 
        - Trying to find the best way to isolate specific data
            - bar graph did not provide the best visualizaton 
            - scatter plot with a line of best fit is better so far
            - created a bubble chart 
                - not sure if this will answer my original question 
                - easy visualization 
            - heat map 
                - did not give results I wanted
            - density plot 
                - did not give wanted results 
            - Pie chart 
                - provides easy visualization
        - Scatter plot with line of best fit and pie chart proving to be the best to answer my question so far
            - Trying to figure out how to add a key to pie chart in order to tell the difference between categories better
    - 11/24
        - plot the results and describe how well it did 
            - after including all of the original data the authors provided the graphs looked clearer
        - try and tune the model or run a different model on the same type and compare how well it does
            - ran bar graph, scatter plot, bubble chart, heat map, density plot, and pie chart
        - did anything change in your results? what does it mean? 
            - nothing changed with my results I was just able to create some better visualization of the original data
        - write a discussion on the final results after you've decided you've finished your analysis
            - after reviewing various graphs I feel as if a scatter plot with a line of best fit and a pie chart give the best visualization in order to answer my question of how much SOD actually effected seed death. based on the graphs it is easy to see that SOD had vary little effect on seedling death when compard to the other variables like distance from fires edge, which effected the seedlings the most.
    - 12/1 
        - writing up and making analysis look nice
            - only include the important steps and describe each step along the way
