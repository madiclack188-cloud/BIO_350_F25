Final Project Notes 

Assignment:
- Either write a paragraph reflection on your work on the final project so far, including the steps listed under the final project module for this week, or submit a link to your github final project folder that covers these points.
    - So far my work on the final project has included finding and understanding the coding process of the paper I have selected. The paper I am using revolves around evaluating herbicide resistance on a type of turf grass that tends to be hard to get rid of. The data is depicted using a normal distribution model. The paper also provides raw data which will make the coding process easier for my final project. The GitHub page that is listed is very thorough and has helped me gather a deeper understanding of the paper.
