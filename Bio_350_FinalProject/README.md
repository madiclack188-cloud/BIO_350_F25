Final Project Notes 

Assignments:
- Either write a paragraph reflection on your work on the final project so far, including the steps listed under the final project module for this week, or submit a link to your github final project folder that covers these points.
    - So far my work on the final project has included finding and understanding the coding process of a paper which did take me a while to find. The paper I am using revolves around discovering how disease and wildfire disturbances alter the likelihood that seedlings sprout. For their statistical analysis they used a Bayesian generalized linear model for each species of tree seedlings they monitored. The link to the paper is: https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ecs2.2991 
    - Objective 
        - "(1) assess the influence of seed limitation, biotic competition, and abiotic conditions on seedling regeneration in resprouting populations; (2) investigate whether disease-fire interactions alter postfire seedling regeneration, which have implications for future disease dynamics and shifts in forest composition"
        - human altered fire regimes 
        - Sudden Oak Death (SOD)
- Have your dataset
    - In my excel drive, on the authors github, and saved in VSCode
- Have a question 
    - Spefics with SOD
        - Attempt to remove wildfire data and find how much SOD influenced seedling regeneration 
    - How much does SOD effect the results of this study? 
- What did you want to model?
    - I would like to do a Bayesian generalized linear model however if it proves to be out of my skillset I will be modeling with a normal linear model 
- Set up the model framework
- X --> description
- Goals for 11/18
    - What was the original paper about?
        - My paper is about how Sudden Oak Death (SOD) disease and wildfire suppression is effecting the likilhood that seedlings will sprout in an area previously effected by a wildfire that wiped out a large area of coastal California. 
        - Objective 
            - "(1) assess the influence of seed limitation, biotic competition, and abiotic conditions on seedling regeneration in resprouting populations; (2) investigate whether disease-fire interactions alter postfire seedling regeneration, which have implications for future disease dynamics and shifts in forest composition"
    - Did it model anything, or are you just using their data?
        - There were models in the original paper, however I am going to use their data to create a model with specific feature selections.
    - What is your question or idea?
        - I am hoping to find out how much Sudden Oak Death (SOD) is impacting seedling survival rates
        - Question 
            - How much does SOD effect seedling death when compared to fire morality? 
    - What are you specifically trying to model?
        - I am specifically trying to isolate the specific categories of the original data 
        - Why? How will it answer you question/idea?
            - I am hoping to better visualize the data and find the most common cause of seedling death.
    - What is your input data type or structure?
        - Numerical 
    - What is your output data type?
        - Numerical 
    - What type of model have you decided to use to model your data? 
        - "Model-based and sequential feature selection" 
        - Should expresses itself in a bar graph 
    - Practical: 
        - Have data loaded
        - Plot initial visualization 
        - Explain your data type and input/output plans for your model
            - Attributes I will be usiung 
                - Average Slope 
                - Elevation 
                - Fire Mortality 
                - Distance from Fire Edge 
                - Pre Fire SOD Mortality
        - Create a train/test data split
        - Explain your model 
            - Run a test using default or standard model parameters 
            - Later this week and over the next 2 weeks we will discuss fine tuning model parameters to generate the most accurate model 
        - Now that you've run the test, what are your results and what do they mean? 
            - The test I have run was mainly to figure out how to make the bar graph I need to answer my question 
            - It was successful, however it only shows what I already know from the data
