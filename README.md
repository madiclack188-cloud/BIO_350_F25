# BIO_350_F25
Staring our BIO350 assignments repo.
IC Assignment 1: Chapter 1 of Ecology Handbook 
    - Making a difference equation 
    - Technical difficulties, SHOULD be better from now on 
    - It works! 



IC Assignment 2: Chapter 2 of Ecology Handbook 
 - Making an exponential equation to measure how quickly duckweed something
 - Minimal technical difficulties, bit better 
 - Works and indtroduced matplotlib, and plotting on x and y axis 



IC Assignment 3: Chapter 3 of Ecology Handbook 
  - logistic growth 
  - how long to fill a 2mx2m plot 
  - 12 starting plant 
  - 40% die every year 
  -  seed germinates 
  - k=400 
  - s=1 
  - x=400
  - b=75 
  - d=0.4
  - r=0.96
  - total days=240
  - Made a good amount of errors before I got it right 
  - how long to fill? 
     - Around 15 years I think 
  - What does the population even out to? 
    - Around 240 I think 




    IC Example 2
      - Instering csv file 
        - Making sure to save it into BIO file
      - Plot code we have been using already 
      - Making adjustments through highlighting code, right click, select "Copilot", then select "editor inline chat"
      - Used this to find a carrying capacity 
      - Enter and hit tab until copilot gave me what I wanted the graph to look like 




      IC Assignment 4
       - I missed class the day this assignment was done 
        - uploaded code from a classmates GitHub 
         - Have not had the chance to full go through it yet, but will update ReadMe once I do

      




      IC Example 3
       - Chapter 4
        - How to calculate and solve for the ability to coexist?
       - Stability 
        - Properties for an equilibrium state 
        - What happens when there is a pertubation (distrubance)?
       - rx= maxium population growth rate of X
       - Kx= carrying capacity
       - competion term alpha: denotes the per capita* effect of y* on x to the effect of X on X
        - in other words, measure intensity of interspecific to* intraspecific competition effects 
       - Paid attention when more changes were made by prof, however I did not follow along because I was worried I   would mess up the code again






      IC Assignment 5
        - SIR models 
          - Susceptable Infection Removed
        - Rabies in foxes (removed/death rate)
          - Fox pop=1000
          - 50% death chance per day 
          - 1/1000 infected to susceptable meet 
          - S=999
          - I=1
          - R=0
          - Beta=1/1000
          - S-beta*S_t*I_t
          - I_t-d*I_t+beta*S_t*T_t
          - R_t+d*I_t
          - S_t+1 + I_t+1 + R_t+1 = S_t + I_t + R_t
          - Beta 
            - Habitat space 
              - Quarantine 
            - Vaccines
          - Death rate 
            - effective treatment 
          - Process 
            - import mat plot 
            - days = 30
            - for loop (30 days)
            - Set return variables 
              - S_t+1
              - St
              - I_t+
              - It
              - R_t+1
              - Rt
          - Giving the function 
            - beta 
            - death rate 
            - S0
            - I0
            - R0
            - time
         






IC Example 4
 - downloading files from canvas
    - make sure to move file to right folder after download
 - translating files into python using in line editor 
 - make sure to create a new bash terminal 
 - make sure to activate IC_Assignments in bash terminal before trying to activate anything 
 - What worked: 
    - importing things before actually starting 
    - checking translations
    - re-translating when given an error
